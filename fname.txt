Question 1 : What is software? What is software engineering?

Answer: Software:
software refers to a collection of programs, data, and instructions that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks.
It encompasses everything from simple applications like text editors and web browsers to complex systems like operating systems, databases, and video games. Software can be categorized into two main types:

1. System Software: 
This type of software includes operating systems, device drivers, utilities, and other programs that enable the computer hardware to function and provide a platform for running application software.

2. Application Software: 
Application software includes programs designed to perform specific tasks for users, such as word processors, web browsers, email clients, and accounting software.

Software Engineering: 

software engineering is the discipline concerned with the application of engineering principles and practices to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. 
It involves systematic approaches to software development, aiming to produce high-quality software that meets user requirements, is reliable, scalable, maintainable, and efficient. 
Software engineers use various methodologies, tools, and techniques to manage the complexities of software development projects, including requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, and deployment. 
The goal of software engineering is to ensure that software products are delivered on time, within budget, and with the desired level of quality.
